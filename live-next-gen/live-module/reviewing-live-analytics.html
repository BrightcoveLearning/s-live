<section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>The Live module provides reports on live streaming event or channel performance. Information including real-time concurrent viewers and aggregated post-event data about the viewer's stream time, geography, and devices are available.</p>
  <p>To view live analytics, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
    <li>Open the <strong>Live</strong> module.</li>
    <li>Click on the three dots for more options.</li>
    <li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Live Media Asset</strong>&nbsp;from the dropdown.</li>

    </figure>
  </ol>
  <p>The analytics dashboard is organized into the following sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#all-time">All time</a></li>
    <li><a href="#engagement">Engagement</a></li>
    <li><a href="#performance">Performance</a></li>
    <li><a href="#performance-engagement">Performance and Engagement</a></li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section class="bcls-section">
  <h2 id="all-time">All time snapshot</h2>
  <p>The All time section will display:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Video Views</strong> - Total number of views over the duration of the live stream.</li>
    <li><strong>Video Impression</strong> - The number of times a video thumbnail or preview is displayed to viewers.</li>
    <li><strong>Completion Rate</strong> - The percentage of viewers who watch a video from start to finish.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewed minutes</strong> - The total amount of time measured in minutes that users spent watching the live stream.</li>
    <li><strong>Engagement Score</strong> - A metric that measures how engaged an audience is with a video.</li>
    <li><strong>Play Rate</strong> - The percentage of times a video is played compared to how often it is viewed.</li>
    <li><strong>Unique Viewers</strong> - Total number of unique viewers watching the stream. For example, if the same user connects to the live stream two separate times within an hour, they would count as 1 unique viewer.</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>
  <h2 id="engagement">Engagement</h2>
  <p>A graph displaying the engagement will be displayed below the Snapshot. The engagement measures the number of sessions connected to the stream at any given time regardless of position. For example, if 10 users are watching the live stream at the live edge and 5 users are watching in the DVR window (10 minutes behind live) the concurrent viewers for the minute will be 15 users.</p>

<h2 id="Notes">Notes</h2>
<p>General notes related to live analytics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analytics are recorded for the default live video ID generated with a Live event. If a customer takes the m3u8 playlist for playback, or creates a remote asset with it (a new video ID), the analytics won't be collected for the new asset.
  </li>
  <li>Only <strong>Concurrent Viewers</strong> will be presented in real-time; other metrics will be collected and aggregated with a delay similar to standard analytics
  </li>
  <li><strong>Concurrent Viewers</strong> is only accurate for streams that are delivered with the Brightcove Player and SDKs (or non-Brightcove Players using the Brightcove Data Collection API)
  </li>
  <li>Data will be available for up to 32 days after the event
  </li>
  <li>Real-time is defined by the aggregated sessions over a one-minute interval
  </li>
  <li>With recurring events (static entry points), analytics will be provided from the start of the most recent activation
  </li>
  <li>At the moment, the analytics module cannot fetch the precise "unique viewer" data and has a discrepancy between LIVE module analytics. Please use the LIVE Analytics UI to confirm the number of viewers.
  </li>
  <li>Certain ad blockers will prevent Live analytics data from loading properly, as shown below:
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-live-img/live-module/ad-blocker-blocks-live-analytics.png" alt="Ad Blocker Blocks Analytics Data">
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Ad Blocker Blocks Analytics Data</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Disabling the ad blocker should resolve the issue.</p>
