      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"> Notes:
        <li>For GAM/Google Ad Manager inegration, the API permissions needed are <strong>CMS Video Read</strong>.</li>
        <li>Selecting a large number of accounts and APIs may cause the HTTP header size to become large and invalid. The maximum header size that our server accepts is 8K, which means that you must select 30 accounts or less to apply the credentials to. For security reasons, we recommend that you limit the scope of permissions for a set of credentials to the smallest set of accounts and operations necessary.</li>

      </li>
      <li>Click<span class="button-blue">Save</span>.</li>

    <h2 id="Managing_client_registrations">Managing client registrations</h2>
    <p>The API Authentication page can be used to view and manage client registrations. Click the <strong>ADMIN</strong> link in the Studio header and then click <strong>API Authentication</strong>. A list of your current registrations will display.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/s-admin-img/general/node14056-registered-apps.webp" /></figure>
    <p>To view the registration details, click the on the name. From here, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify the name</li>
      <li>Copy the client ID</li>
      <li>Add accounts for authorization</li>
      <li>Select additional APIs to enable</li>
      <li>Delete the credential</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Click <span class="button-blue">Save</span> to save your changes.</p>
    <p>Note that if a credential is created for multiple accounts, users will only see that credential if they have access to all of those accounts. For example, User 1 creates a credential for accounts A &amp; B. User 2 logs in and only has access to account A. User 2 will not see the credential as they do not have access to account B.</p>

    <h2 id="GAM">Working with GAM</h2>
    <p>If you currently have multiple {{ site.product_short }} accounts set up as content sources in GAM, you have two options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You can create a unique Client ID and Client Secret for each {{ site.product_short }} account thatâ€™s set up as a content source in GAM. For example, if you have 10 {{ site.product_short }} accounts, you'd have 10 applications named GAM in your API Authentication settings in {{ site.product_short }}.</li>
      <li>You can create a single Client ID and Client Secret for all {{ site.product_short }} accounts that have been set up as content sources in GAM. For example, if you have 10 {{ site.product_short }} accounts, you'd have 1 application named GAM in your API Authentication settings in {{ site.product_short }}.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Regardless of whether you chose option #1 or #2, for each content source that you set up in GAM, you need to provide a unique Account ID. So, you are not reducing the number of content sources that are currently set up in GAM; you're just replacing the read token with the Client ID and Client Secret, which can either be the same across content sources or unique for each.</p>
    <p>Option #1 takes more time up front. However, if the Client ID and Client Secret are the same across all content sources (as with option #2), it will be a burden to add a new content source because you will need to generate a new Client ID and Client Secret and update all of content sources in GAM. So, Brightcove recommends option #1.</p>
